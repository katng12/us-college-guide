					<h3>Be Financially Prepared</h3>
					<p>It's sad and unreasonable, but accept it. US colleges have ridiculously high costs of attendance, which can be a huge burden for international students. There are several scholarships that you can apply for, but keep in mind that most of those are pretty competitive, so make sure to polish your resume.</p>
